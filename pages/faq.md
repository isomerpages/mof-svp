### 1. Will this replace GeBIZ?

No. GeBIZ will still be the primary platform to transact with the public sector for procurement of goods and services. Quotations and Tenders will continue to be called in GeBIZ.<BR><BR>
This is an **additional** means for Government to make ad-hoc smaller value purchases.

### 2. What is this 'middleware'?

It is an application programming interface (API) developed by the Government to interface with businesses’ digital commercial platforms. The 'middleware' is also designed to address Government’s needs (e.g. financial governance and data reconciliation). 

### 3. Do businesses need to login to the 'middleware'?

There is no need for businesses to login to the 'middleware'. The 'middleware' will interface at the backend with businesses’ commercial digital platform.

### 4. Is there a need to upload a catalogue, like GeBIZ Mall?

GeBIZ Mall requires businesses to upload catalogues onto the GeBIZ platform. On the other hand, this initiative leverages businesses’ own commercial digital platform that is used for online transactions with other businesses or the public, so there is no need to maintain a separate catalogue.

### 5. What is required for businesses to be part of this initiative? 
Businesses will need to have a commercial digital platform which can support online transactions (i.e. allow buyers to browse listing of products and make purchases of products from the same site). In addition, businesses must be able to meet the technical interfacing requirements, for example to include a feature for buyers to add corporate billing. Finally, businesses will need to agree to the standard terms of use for the 'middleware'. 

### 6. How does invoicing work in this initiative? 
Under this initiative, we do not require businesses to generate any physical/PDF invoices. What is required for payment are structured data that list the order and delivery information for the invoicing period. The intent is to reduce physical processing and raise productivity among buyers and businesses. 

Businesses shall only submit these data (through their commercial digital platforms) to the 'middleware' when the order has been completed, i.e. goods have been delivered and delivery has been confirmed. 

Payment will only be made after these data have been verified by the 'middleware'. 

### 7. What is the credit term for this new model?
14 days, upon successful delivery of order and verification of invoice details.

### 8. Will there be an exclusive arrangement with only one commercial digital platform? 

Businesses that can meet the interfacing requirements (please refer to FAQ#5) can be part of this initiative. However, there is no guarantee of minimum volume of purchases by the Government under this initiative.

### 9. When can I participate in this initiative?
