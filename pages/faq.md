## How will this initiative benefit me as the suppliers?

The new model seeks to reduce processing work for all parties including suppliers across procure to pay (e.g. no need to raise e-invoices on Vendors@Gov and hence faster payment lead time).  Secondly, by bringing your businesses online via the interface to the public sector’s “middleware”, SMEs can digitalise your processes from order to invoice to payment, and improve productivity. The new model’s process and standards will be published openly on (more details will be shared subsequently) and suppliers can consider replicating a similar solution to other corporate clients. Onboarding this model will open up new opportunities for SMEs to access an additional channel to supply government agencies and other buyers and expand their reach beyond Singapore’s shores.

## Will this replace GeBIZ? 

No. GeBIZ will still be the primary platform to transact with the public sector for procurement of goods and services. Quotations and Tenders will continue to be called in GeBIZ.
This new model is an additional channel for ad-hoc low value purchases.

## Will GeBIZ host the middleware? Do I as the supplier need to login to the middleware?

No, the “middleware” will be hosted separately from the GeBIZ system. Hence, there is no need for suppliers to login to the “middleware” unlike GeBIZ Mall today. The “middleware” will interface at the back-end with your e-commerce site.

## How different is this initiative from the existing GeBIZ Mall?

GeBIZ Mall’s model requires suppliers to upload your catalogues onto the GeBIZ platform. There are also currently some limitations to GeBIZ Mall’s features, such as size of images. On the other hand, this new model proposes to leverage your e-commerces’ site/platform, so there is no need for additional efforts to maintain the catalogue (unlike in GeBIZ Mall), while at the same time allowing our government buyers to access your latest products and prices on the your e-commerce platforms.

## What is required before I can be on-boarded to this new model? 

You will need to have an e-commerce site which can support online transactions (i.e. allow buyers to browse listing of products and service and make purchases of products or services from the same site). In addition, your site must be able to meet the technical interfacing requirements (technical details will be shared subsequently). For example, you will be required to include a feature for buyers to add corporate billing. Finally, you will need to agree to the standard terms of use for the proposed “middleware” that we are building to interface with your site.

## How do we ensure that buys are from legitimate public officers? Do we need to limit the type or value of purchases made by certain buyers? 

The “middleware” (i.e. Government’s technical solution that will interface with e-commerce sites) will facilitate such checks. Suppliers will also be informed of who are verified public officers on a regular basis by the “middleware”.
Suppliers need only process carts that have been approved.
There is no need for suppliers to limit the type of products or services offered on your e-commerce sites to corporate buyers.

## How does invoicing work in this new model? 

Invoicing in the new model will depart from the traditional invoicing practice. We do not require suppliers to provide an additional consolidated invoice on top of individual invoices for each order. We also do not require e-commerce sites to produce invoices on behalf of your sellers, as we understand the industry practice is for sellers to issue their own invoices.

There will be no need for suppliers to generate any physical/PDF invoices per se. Instead, what we require for payment are structured data that list the order and delivery information for the invoicing period. The intent is to reduce processing and raise productivity among buyers and our partnering e-commerce sites. 


E-commerce sites shall only submit these data to the “middleware” when the order has been completed, i.e. goods have been delivered and delivery has been confirmed. Refund/return cases shall not be included. 

Payment will only be made after these data have been verified by the “middleware”.
